<h3 id="rubix---api-management-competence-lead">Rubix - API Management competence lead</h3>
<h4 id="2011---2020">2011 - 2020</h4>
<p>At Rubix I held the position of API Management competence lead which is one of the working groups within Rubix. In this role I am responsible for supporting sales, delivery, recruitment, knowledge development and coaching of employees in the field of API Management. To keep alignment with other competences and sales and delivery I am also part of the Sales and Delivery team. All of the above tasks I perform one day a week. Since I have great affinity with the technical aspects of API Management and underlying concepts, I am still active as a consultant for the remaining four days per week. In this role, I am participating in various projects at various customers, the details of some I describe below in noteworthy projects.</p>
<p>Before my position as API Management competence lead, I started the open source competence within Rubix, together with another colleague. Similar to the API Management competence lead role, I was responsible for knowledge management, supporting sales and delivery and recruitment, as well as the set-up of the partnership with Red Hat. The Open source competence grew from two people in 2014 to 15 people in 2018 under my lead. At that point we decided to split the group due to its size and variety of focus areas; API Management being one of them.</p>
<p>I started at Rubix in 2011 as an integration specialist working primarily with the TIBCO product stack. Until 2014 I was active for a multitude of customers and projects after which I made the switch to open source software, primarily using Red Hat technology.</p>

<p>Working as an integration specialist for Eneco, I fulfilled multiple roles in various projects. Examples are: developer, designer, architect, BPM specialist and process specialist. Eneco for a long time had two main integration platforms, Microsoft BizTalk and TIBCO BusinessWorks. My development work was on both of these platforms. Eventually I was also involved in the project to rationalize the two platforms towards TIBCO.</p>
