      <description>One of the most frequently used constructs in Apache Camel is the Processor (http://camel.apache.org/processor.html), it is used ofter for invoking custom code or performing message translations. The API of the processor is very clear and well documented. As are numerous examples available for using a Camel Processor. The lesser known brother of the Processor is the AsyncProcessor (http://camel.apache.org/asynchronous-processing.html) which is less documented and a less frequently used. Mainly because the AsyncProcessor is mainly targeted for Camel Component developers.</description>
