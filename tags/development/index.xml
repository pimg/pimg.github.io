      <description>In first part of our multi-part blog series about 3scale policy development we looked into the setup of a development environment. Now we have a functioning development environment we can start the actual development of the 3scale policy. In this part we will take a look and use the scaffolding utility provided by APIcast to generate a policy scaffold.
The first thing we are going to do is create a new git branch of the APIcast source we have cloned in the previous part.</description>
