      <description>3Scale is an API Management platform used for authenticating an throttleing API calls among many, many other things. Now when thinking of API’s most people think of RESTfull API’s these days. And altough 3Scale primarily targets RESTfull API’s it is also possible to use other types of API’s as this blog will demonstrate. In this post we will use a Camel JMS subscriber in combination with ActiveMQ and authenticate requests against the 3Scale API Management platform.</description>

      <description>One of the more commonly used EIP’s in Camel is the Splitter, you can find the documentation here http://camel.apache.org/splitter.html
Usually the splitter is used for tokenizing some message or splitting collections into single messages. But what if you need something more specific? It is good to know that the splitter can either split on Java collection types as well as Iterators. In this blog we are going to create a custom Iterator helper class and method.</description>

      <description>One of the most frequently used constructs in Apache Camel is the Processor (http://camel.apache.org/processor.html), it is used ofter for invoking custom code or performing message translations. The API of the processor is very clear and well documented. As are numerous examples available for using a Camel Processor. The lesser known brother of the Processor is the AsyncProcessor (http://camel.apache.org/asynchronous-processing.html) which is less documented and a less frequently used. Mainly because the AsyncProcessor is mainly targeted for Camel Component developers.</description>

      <title>Apache Camel - Dynamic redelivery based on MEP</title>

      <description>The exception handling and retry mechanisms in Apache Camel are quite extensive. In this blogpost we are going to take a look at customizing the retry based on a predicate implementation of our own thereby enabling really fine grained retry logic.
In our example we are going to look at the MEP of the exchange, whenever it is inOnly we are going to retry since no synchronous subscriber is waiting for the response.</description>
