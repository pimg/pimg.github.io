      <description>I recently ran into a problem where I needed to create an Openshift healthcheck for a Fuse container. Normally all Fuse containers exposed an http endpoint which was used in the healthcheck. However additional security requirements dictated the use of client certificates. Currently it is not possible to create a healthcheck with a two-way-ssl connection.
As another way to monitor if all Camel routes are started I decided to leverage the JMX beans exposed by Jolokia.</description>
