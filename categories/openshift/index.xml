      <description>I recently ran into a problem where I needed to create an Openshift healthcheck for a Fuse container. Normally all Fuse containers exposed an http endpoint which was used in the healthcheck. However additional security requirements dictated the use of client certificates. Currently it is not possible to create a healthcheck with a two-way-ssl connection.
As another way to monitor if all Camel routes are started I decided to leverage the JMX beans exposed by Jolokia.</description>

      <description>Openshift is a Paas platform offered by Red Hat based mainly on Docker and Kubernetes. One of the concepts behind it is that Ops can set boundaries for Dev. For example by providing a list of supported technologies in the form of base images. One other way Ops can further control the Paas cluster is to impose various limits on the components running in Openshift.
However, Openshift currently has three different ways of setting restrictions on different levels which do interconnect in an implicit way.</description>
